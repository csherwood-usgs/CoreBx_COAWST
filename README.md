# CoreBx_COAWST
Routines used to manipulate input grids and plot results for North Core Banks COAWST model

#### Notes on coordinate conversion
* Converted lat/lon to 'island' coordinates in two steps:
```
from pyproj import Transformer
transformer = Transformer.from_crs( 'epsg:4326', 'epsg:26918',  ) # WGS84 to UTM18

utmx, utmy = transformer.transform( lat, lon )
xisl, yisl = UTM2Island(utmx, utmy, eoff=383520.0, noff=3860830.0, rot=42.0)
print('Shape of xisl, yisl: ', xisl.shape, yisl.shape)
```
(UTM2Island is in ncbx_funcs.py)  
* Offset was determined based on the averarge shoreline postion (z=0) between i=100:1200 in the final CSYV bathy.  
This ended up being index 168, or y = 329.28 in island coordinates.

### Plots for Warner Dorian paper  (revised May 2)

There continue to be lots of extraneous files.

Major changes associated with revisions to the paper:
* Attempts to split up big files and produce figures with files
* Improvments in multi-panel figures
* Correction of labelled sediment calculations
* Use of local versions of the concatenated `.his` files.

* Redo figure 2, panel c
* TODO - list figure changes

I was having problems pulling the big 4D datasets (like SSC) from THREDDS, so John W. used ncks to concatenate many (but not all) of the
 variables into one big `.his` file, which I downloaded to the Puget Systems Win10 desktop.
